I ran the experiment with N changing from 1 to 100 and found that after N=23, the accuracy became 0.8333, and after N=50, the accuracy became 0.8611. I think this is because we eliminate those most common words we obversved in topwords. Those common words usually bring us no information for our classification, so if we don't count them into our consideration, we get a better accuracy.
